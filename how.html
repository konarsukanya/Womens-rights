    <h2>Gender Inequality</h2>
    <p>Gender inequality could include:</p>
        
    <h3>Gender-Based Violence</h3>
    <p>Gender-based violence is when violent acts are committed against women and LGBTI people on the basis of their orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics. Gender based violence happens to women and girls in disproportionate numbers.

Women and girls in conflict are especially at risk from violence, and throughout history sexual violence has been used as a weapon of war. For example, we have documented how many women who fled attacks from Boko Haram in Nigeria have been  subjected to sexual violence and rape by the Nigerian military.

Globally, on average 30% of all women who have been in a relationship have experienced physical and/or sexual violence committed against them by their partner. Women are more likely to be victims of sexual assault including rape, and are more likely to be the victims of so-called “honour crimes”.

Violence against women is a major human rights violation. It is the responsibility of a state to protect women from gender-based violence –  even domestic abuse behind closed doors.</p><div class="space"></div>
    <h3>Sexual Violence and Harassment</h3>
    <p>Sexual harassment means any unwelcome sexual behaviour. This could be physical conduct and advances, demanding or requesting sexual favours or using inappropriate sexual language.

Sexual violence is when someone is physically sexually assaulted. Although men and boys can also be victims of sexual violence, it is women and girls who are overwhelmingly affected.</p><div class="space"></div>
    <h3>Workplace Discrimination</h3>
    <p>Often, women are the subject of gender based discrimination in the workplace. One way of illustrating this is to look at the<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Gender_pay_gap_statistics"> gender pay gap.</a> Equal pay for the same work is a human right, but time and again women are denied access to a fair and equal wage. Recent figures show that women currently earn roughly 77% of what men earn for the same work. This leads to a lifetime of financial disparity for women, prevents them from fully exercising independence, and means an increased risk of poverty in later life. <div class="space"></div>
</p>
    <h3>Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity </h3>
    <p>In many countries around the world, women are denied their rights on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, or sex characteristics. Lesbian, bisexual, trans and intersex women and gender non-confirming people face violence, exclusion, harassment, and discrimination Many are also subjected to extreme violence, including sexual violence or so called “corrective rape” and “honour killings.” </p><div class="space"></div>
